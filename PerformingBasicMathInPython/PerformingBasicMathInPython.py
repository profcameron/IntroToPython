# Example 1: You want the variable total to be equal to 3 plus 5
total = 3 + 5
print("Example 1: ", total)

# Example 2: You want the variable due to be equal to 500 minus 50
due = 500 - 50
print("Example 2: ", due)

# Example 3: You want the variable total to be equal to number1 plus number2
# Note: You can re-use the same variable name as in Example 1
# In the future, we will change these to use input
number1 = 45
number2 = 55
total = number1 + number2

# Example 4: Create a variable doubleTime and set it equal to double hourlyRate
hourlyRate = 15
doubleTime = hourlyRate * 2
print("Example 4: ", doubleTime)

# Example 5: Create a variable avgGrade and set it equal to totalPoints divided by 3
totalPoints = 80 + 90 + 70
avgGrade = totalPoints / 3
print("Example 5: ", avgGrade)

# Example 6: Calculate your weekly paycheck in a variable called paycheck
# You were paid 40 hours at $10/hour and 10 overtime hours at $15/hour
paycheck = 40 * 10 + 10 * 15
print("Example 6: ", paycheck)

# Example 7: Create a variable totalMoney and set it equal to yourQuarters plus myQuarters multiplied by 0.25
yourQuarters = 10
myQuarters = 10
totalMoney = (yourQuarters + myQuarters) * 0.25
print("Example 7: ", totalMoney)
